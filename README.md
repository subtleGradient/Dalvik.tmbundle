# Android Dalvik bytecode hacking with TexMate 2

* Open a `dex` file in TextMate.
* It'll show you the bytecode as smali code.
* Edit the smali code.
* Save the `dex` file
* It'll convert it back into bytecode

You can also keep a dex file open in TextMate. When you recompile the dex code it'll update automatically. It's pretty hip, even if I do say so myself ;)
